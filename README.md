1. A Briefe Examination; Of a Certaine Pamphlet lately Printed in Scotland, and Intituled: Ladenſium Autocatacriſis, &c.
1. THere was written in Scotland, and directed to the high Court of the Parliament of England, at th2. But before I meddle with matters of Opinion, I muſt expoſtulate ſome things with this Authour, wh3. And thirdly; why, a Demonſtration by their owne Confeſsions? Doe they confeſſe the Fact? Indeed y4. But in your We offer to inſtruct to the full ſatisfaction of the whole world of free and inprejudOnce more; If you will needs miſtake theſe men to be Arminians, and Papiſts, and upholders of Tyrann6. Now in your Preface, this chimaera of the Canterburian faction and the Prelates, muſt bee ſtigmat8 Comming up to your Work, you tell us, you will prove theſe men, againſt whom you informe, to be gu9 Firſt, that in caſe you faile in this great buſineſſe, you are content, you ſay, to be cenſured of10. The other thing is: you complaine of the obſtinate ſilence of the Engliſh Divines: it is moſt pr11. In your firſt Chapter; you ſeeme to ſeare the World is miſtaken in your Quarrell, and doth not u12. You have brought us next a long Syllogiſme, which is to be the touchſtone of your whole diſcourſ12. Next, in your Minor: I may not ſuffer you to jumpe out of England into Scotland; as you do in th13 Firſt, touching Arminianiſme, in relation to Fact: It is but hard meaſure in you to repreſent it 14. The greateſt Accuſation that lies againſt my Lord of Canterbury here, in this matter of Arminian15. That which brought up Arminianiſme among you, was, you ſay, P. 11.a gentle ayre from Court: whic16. Paſſing over into Ireland, you queſtion there: P. 15. P. 21.Who holds downe the head of that Ort17. Your aptneſſe to miſconſtrue even the beſt
 actions, appeares by the cenſure you put upon His Ma18. Needs will you make the world believe; in this quarrell of Arminianiſme, my Lord of Canterburies19. Much adoe you make about Chounes Booke: where you begin with the Licenſe, but miſtake the
Licenſ21. In your third Chapter you P. 31. taxe my Lord of Canterbury for promoving Maſter Duries Negotiat22. And thus much of Fact, now to matter of Doctrine, or Opinion; wherein all that is objected will 23. In the point of Arminianiſme, one paſſage is
 ſaid to bee gotten from his Graces Pen: And that i24. This is all you can get from his Grace's Pen, to helpe on the clamour here; except that you tell25. The hard ſhift you make to finde out ſuch Objections as theſe, are his Graces moſt evident Purga26. Now we go on to Popery, where the firſt point objected to my Lord of Canterbury, is: That he hol27. But the Popes Antichriſtianiſme, being thus (as you falſly pretend) removed by my Lord of
Canter28. But among all the Paradoxes charged here by you upon the Divines of our Church, this I ſtood ama29. Next it offends you, P. 39. my L. of Canterbury ſhould exempt himſelfe from the juriſdiction of 30. But it offends you moſt of all: that he ſays, We and the Papiſts are of one religion: yet he giv31. In like manner, it offends you, P. 44. that my Lord of Canterbury, in all that large Booke ſet o32. But firſt, touching Schiſme: doth my Lord of Canterbury no where charge the Papiſts with Schiſme33. Next how ſhould we be ſure, neither the Archbiſhop nor any of his Favourites charge the Papiſts 34. For the ſecond, which is Haereſie: Even thoſe Errours of Rome which they hold not to be contra f35. Thirdly Concerning Idolatrie; though the Papiſts be very nice in their doctrine here, yet it is 36. His like frequent overſtrainings in this kind, are an evident demonſtration, that he ſet himſelf37. Our Divines ſay; there is a Difference in Caſe of Schiſme or Hereſie, betwixt the Simple, and th38. Hitherto you have ſtood upon Generalls, you tell us; now you will come up cloſe to the Canterbur39. Concerning the holy Table or Altar, your Accuſation is, Canterbury ſaith, that Worſhip, yea and 40. Now that he ſaith, Great reverence is due to the Body, and ſo to the Throne where this Body is u41. But touching the point in hand; we are very much unſatisfied, ſince all Primitive Chriſtianity, 42. This being paſt, you have little elſe to object to him, inſomuch that after the intervall of man43. Touching Images, Reliques, and Invocation of Saints; I finde of my Lord of Canterbury, Nè
